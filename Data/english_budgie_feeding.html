    <h1>Feeding Guide</h1>

    <h2>Basic Diet</h2>
    <p>
        English Budgies, like their American counterparts, do well on a seed-based diet. However, this should be complemented with fresh fruits and vegetables. Pelleted diets available in the market can serve as a balanced nutritional choice for these birds.
    </p>

    <h2>Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
    <p>
        English Budgies are fond of fresh produce. Offer them a variety of fruits and veggies such as apples, oranges, carrots, broccoli, and leafy greens. It's important to wash these items thoroughly and ensure that any uneaten portions are removed from the cage within several hours to avoid spoilage.
    </p>

    <h2>Proteins</h2>
    <p>
        Every so often, provide your English Budgie with protein-rich foods. This can include hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, and small portions of cooked lean meat. Always ensure these protein sources are unseasoned and free from any additives.
    </p>

    <h2>Water</h2>
    <p>
        Always ensure that your English Budgie has access to fresh, clean water. The water container should be regularly cleaned and replenished daily to keep bacterial growth at bay.
    </p>

    <h2>Supplements</h2>
    <p>
        If an English Budgie is primarily on a seed-based diet, it might require additional vitamin and mineral supplements. It's always a good idea to check with an avian veterinarian to assess the specific needs of your bird.
    </p>

    <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>
    <p>
        There are certain foods that are detrimental to budgies. Keep them away from avocados, chocolates, any form of caffeine, alcohol, and seeds from certain fruits like apples. Additionally, foods high in salt or sugar content should be avoided.
