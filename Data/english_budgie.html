<p>The English Budgie, also known as the Show or Exhibition Budgerigar, is a larger and more robust variant of the typical budgerigar or "parakeet". Bred for show, these birds possess a distinctive appearance characterized by their fuller feathered head and crown, giving them a more "puffy" look compared to their wild counterparts. They come in a myriad of colors and patterns and are known for their calm and gentle demeanor, making them popular pets. English Budgies tend to have a shorter lifespan than their wild-type peers, averaging 5-7 years.</p>
