    <h1>Feeding Guide</h1>

    <h2>Basic Diet</h2>
    <p>
        American Budgies primarily thrive on a seed-based diet, but it should be supplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables. Commercially available pelleted diets are also a balanced nutritional option for budgies.
    </p>

    <h2>Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
    <p>
        Budgies love fresh fruits and vegetables. Offer them items like apples, oranges, carrots, broccoli, and leafy greens. Always ensure the produce is washed thoroughly and remove any uneaten fresh food from the cage within a few hours to prevent spoilage.
    </p>

    <h2>Proteins</h2>
    <p>
        Occasionally, you can offer protein sources like hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, or cooked lean meat in small amounts. Ensure these are free from seasonings or additives.
    </p>

    <h2>Water</h2>
    <p>
        Fresh and clean water should be available to your budgie at all times. The water dish should be cleaned and refilled daily to prevent bacterial growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Supplements</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on their diet, budgies might need vitamin and mineral supplements. Consult with an avian veterinarian to determine what's best for your specific bird.
    </p>

    <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>
    <p>
        Certain foods are toxic or harmful to budgies. Avoid giving them avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, seeds from fruits (like apple seeds), and salty or sugary foods.
