    <h1>Cockatiel Feeding Guide</h1>

    <h2>Primary Diet</h2>
    <p>
        Cockatiels are primarily seed-eaters. A good quality cockatiel seed mix will be a foundation of their diet. However, it's important to supplement this with other foods to ensure a balanced diet.
    </p>

    <h2>Pelleted Diets</h2>
    <p>
        Many avian veterinarians recommend pelleted diets as they are well-balanced and reduce the risk of selecting a nutritionally imbalanced diet, which can occur with seed-only diets.
    </p>

    <h2>Fruits and Vegetables</h2>
    <p>
        Fresh fruits and vegetables are crucial for a cockatiel's diet. They provide essential vitamins and minerals not always found in a seed or pelleted diet.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Safe fruits: Apples (no seeds), bananas, berries, melons, and grapes.</li>
        <li>Safe vegetables: Broccoli, carrots, peas, spinach, and sweet potatoes.</li>
        <li>Always remove any uneaten fresh food after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Foods to Avoid</h2>
    <p>
        Certain foods are toxic or harmful to Cockatiels and should be avoided.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Coffee or caffeinated beverages</li>
        <li>Alcohol</li>
        <li>Onions and garlic in large amounts</li>
        <li>Fruit seeds and pits (like apple seeds)</li>
        <li>Raw or undercooked beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Water</h2>
    <p>
        Fresh water should be available at all times. Ensure that the water is clean and free from contaminants. Change and refill the water dish daily.
    </p>

    <h2>Treats and Supplements</h2>
    <p>
        Occasionally, you can offer your Cockatiel treats like millet sprays or honey sticks. However, these should be given in moderation. Calcium supplements, like cuttlebones, can also be provided to support bone health.
