    <h1>Care Guide</h1>

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>
        English Budgies flourish on a diverse diet consisting of premium seed mixes, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Along with fresh water every day, also provide them with cuttlebone or mineral blocks to ensure they get essential calcium and minerals.

    <h2>Cage Setup</h2>
    <p>
        English Budgies, being slightly larger, need roomy cages to comfortably move and fly. A horizontal cage orientation is ideal, allowing them to stretch their wings. Equip the cage with varied perch diameters to keep their feet in good shape. Ensure the cage is positioned away from direct sunlight and drafts.

    <h2>Toys and Enrichment</h2>
    <p>
        A mentally stimulated budgie is a happy budgie. Toys are crucial in achieving this. To maintain their interest, introduce a new toy while rotating out an old one regularly. Favorites include swings, ladders, bells, and toys that encourage foraging.

    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <p>
        English Budgies mostly groom themselves, but they appreciate the occasional misting or a shallow water dish for baths. Keep an eye on their nails and beakâ€”trim them if they grow excessively to ensure their comfort.
    </p>

    <h2>Handling and Socialization</h2>
    <p>
        Regular and gentle handling enriches an English Budgie's life, fostering trust with their human companions. Engage with them daily by talking and offering supervised out-of-cage time in a safe space, permitting them to freely fly and interact.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Check</h2>
    <p>
        Scheduling routine visits with an avian veterinarian is a cornerstone of proactive care. Always be observant for signs of distress or illness, such as behavioral shifts, altered appearance, or changes in their droppings. Addressing health concerns promptly is paramount for your English Budgie's health.
