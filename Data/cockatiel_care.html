    <h1>Care Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>Housing</h2>
    <p>
        Cockatiels require a spacious cage, preferably rectangular in shape. Ensure that the cage bars are spaced no wider than 3/4 inch apart to prevent escape. Provide horizontal bars for climbing and various perches of different materials and thicknesses to promote foot health.
    </p>

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>
        A balanced diet is essential:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> While Cockatiels naturally eat seeds, ensure they don't become the sole component of their diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Pellets:</strong> High-quality pellets can form a base of a Cockatiel's diet.</li>
        <li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> Fresh produce provides essential vitamins and minerals. Ensure they're clean and free from pesticides.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Always have fresh water available. Change it daily or if it becomes dirty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hygiene</h2>
    <p>
        Cleanliness is crucial:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean the cage at least once a week.</li>
        <li>Provide a shallow dish for your Cockatiel to bathe in, or mist them with clean water.</li>
        <li>Regularly check and trim their nails and beak if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Enrichment</h2>
    <p>
        To prevent boredom and promote mental health:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Offer a variety of toys and change them frequently.</li>
        <li>Introduce puzzle toys that stimulate their intellect.</li>
        <li>Play music or talk to your Cockatiel; they might even mimic you!</li>
        <li>Allow out-of-cage time for flight and exploration in a safe environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p>
        Regular check-ups with an avian veterinarian are important. Watch for signs of illness like changes in behavior, appearance, or droppings. Early detection can be key to successful treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>Social Interaction</h2>
    <p>
        Cockatiels are sociable birds and thrive on interaction with their owners. Spend quality time with your bird daily. If you have a single Cockatiel, consider getting a mirror toy as a form of companionship.
