    <h1>Care Guide</h1>

    <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>
        American Budgies thrive on a balanced diet comprising of quality seed mixes, fresh fruits, and vegetables. It's important to provide fresh water daily and occasionally supplement their diet with cuttlebone or mineral blocks for added calcium and minerals.

    <h2>Cage Setup</h2>
    <p>
        Budgies require spacious cages to move and fly around. A horizontal cage is preferable over a vertical one. Include perches of different diameters to exercise their feet, and ensure their cage is placed in a location away from direct sunlight and drafts.
    </p>

    <h2>Toys and Enrichment</h2>
    <p>
        Toys play a significant role in a budgie's life, keeping them mentally and physically stimulated. Rotate toys regularly to keep them engaged and avoid boredom. Swings, ladders, bells, and foraging toys are excellent choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <p>
        While budgies are self-sufficient in grooming, offering a shallow dish of water or a gentle misting can help them clean themselves. Regularly check and trim their nails and beak, if necessary, to prevent overgrowth.
    </p>

    <h2>Handling and Socialization</h2>
    <p>
        Budgies are sociable and require daily interaction with their caregivers. Handle them gently, speak to them often, and let them out of their cage (in a safe environment) for free flight and interaction.
    </p>

    <h2>Health Check</h2>
    <p>
        Regular check-ups with an avian veterinarian can help detect and prevent potential health issues. Monitor for signs of illness, including changes in behavior, appearance, or droppings. Early detection is crucial for the well-being of your budgie.
